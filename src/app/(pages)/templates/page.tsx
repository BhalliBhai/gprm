    bestFor: [
      "Students and early-career developers",
      "Anyone whose profile is mainly seen by recruiters doing a quick scan",
    ],
    description:
      "Minimalist strips a profile down to a short bio, a tight tech stack row, and nothing that competes for attention. It's the safest default if you're not sure which template to pick - it reads well no matter who's looking at it.",

  {
    slug: "data-driven",
    name: "Data-Driven",
    tagline: "Metrics-first profile for engineering impact.",
    bestFor: [
      "Open-source maintainers with contribution history worth showing",
      "Engineers who want stats, streaks, and top languages to speak for them",
    ],
    description:
      "Data-Driven puts GitHub stats cards, contribution streaks, and top-language breakdowns near the top of the page instead of at the bottom. It works best once you actually have activity worth surfacing - it's less effective on a brand-new account with little history.",
  },
  {
    slug: "developer",
    name: "Developer",
    tagline: "Balanced profile with strong technical depth.",
    bestFor: [
      "Full-stack and backend developers",
      "Anyone who wants both a tech stack and a project list without overloading either",
    ],
    description:
      "Developer is the middle ground between Minimalist and Data-Driven - enough structure to show depth (stack, projects, stats) without any one section dominating the page. It's a good fit if you can't decide between the two extremes.",
  },
  {
    slug: "creative",
    name: "Creative",
    tagline: "Animated banner header with bold visual energy.",
    bestFor: [
      "Designers and frontend developers building a personal brand",
      "Anyone who wants their profile to stand out visually, not just read well",
    ],
    description:
      "Creative leads with an animated banner and leans into visual personality rather than a strict resume format. It's the right choice when you want your profile to feel distinctive - it's a worse fit for strictly formal, recruiter-only audiences.",
  },
  {
    slug: "compact",
    name: "Compact",
    tagline: "Ultra concise format for quick scanning.",
    bestFor: [
      "Developers who prefer their pinned repositories to do most of the talking",
      "Anyone who wants a profile that reads in under 10 seconds",
    ],
    description:
      "Compact trims the profile down to the essentials - a one- or two-line bio, a small stack row, and links. It's the fastest template to scan, which makes it a good fit if you'd rather let your pinned projects carry the weight.",
  },
  {
    slug: "terminal",
    name: "Terminal",
    tagline: "Hacker-style CLI aesthetic for the command-line crowd.",
    bestFor: [
      "Sysadmins, DevOps engineers, and CLI tool authors",
      "Developers who want a distinctive, code-first look",
    ],
    description:
      "Terminal styles the profile like a command-line session - monospace type, prompt-style lines, terminal-green or amber accents. It's a strong fit if your work and audience are already command-line-heavy; it can feel like a mismatch on a profile aimed at non-technical recruiters.",
  },
  {
    slug: "corporate",
    name: "Corporate",
    tagline: "Structured, resume-style layout for recruiter-facing profiles.",
    bestFor: [
      "Freelancers and consultants presenting to clients",
      "Active job seekers who want their GitHub profile to double as a resume",
    ],
    description:
      "Corporate organizes the profile into clearly labeled sections - Experience, Skills, Projects - closer to a resume than a typical developer profile. It's the most formal template and works well when the profile needs to stand on its own for a non-technical reader.",
